## 💡 Approach

I started by breaking down my website into smaller parts - first by pages, then by components, trying to clearly understand which one needed states and props to pass or be passed. A lot of time went into reading through the limited, at times incorrect documentation of the third-party RoadGoat API and learning Bootstrap and TailwindCSS in the very short time retraint; however, it was a challenge I was eager to overcome and learn from to prepare for working with other third-party APIs or even creating my own API in the future for others to use.

## User Stories 

✈️ As a potential traveler (individual or with a group/business team) who is deciding between two travel destinations, I want to be able to compare the two cities' qualities, so that I can choose the city I will travel to based on the qualities I am or my group is interested in/need.

✈️ As an Airbnb, Kayak or GetYourGuide user, I want to know more about my potential destinations before I search for lodging/car rentals/tours/guides, so I know which city to type in these websites' search inputs.

✈️ As a travel site user, I want a home button to clear my previous searches, so that I can compare two other cities or one with another city.

✈️ As a travel site user, I want to be able to access booking sites to the corresponding city I choose, so that I can easily book lodging, flights, and any other potential travel essentials I need for my destination.



## 🏃‍♀️ Future Goals

* Finding an image collection API based on cities to incorporate into results page
* Allowing users to compare more cities
